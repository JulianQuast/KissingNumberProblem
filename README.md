KissingNumberProblem
====================

A small approach to the Kissing number problem

The class KissingNumberProblem.java contains the function kissTest.
It's first argument is the Dimension of the testing it's second argument the number of spheres.
For those who don't know the Kissing number problem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_number_problem

It's not possible to proof values with this algorithm, but we can find lower limits and guesses.

Calculation times on a 64-bit quadcore, Intel core i3 CPU 550 @ 3.20 GHz, 4.0 GB DDR-RAM

2 dimensions, 5 spheres: 0 seconds

2 dimensions, 6 spheres: 0 seconds

KissingNumber(2) = 6

3 dimensions, 11 spheres: 0 seconds

3 dimensions, 12 spheres: 0 seconds

KissingNumber(3) = 12

4 dimensions, 19 spheres: 0 seconds

4 dimensions, 20 spheres: 0 seconds

4 dimensions, 21 spheres: 0 seconds

4 dimensions, 22 spheres: 0 seconds

4 dimensions, 23 spheres:

4 dimensions, 24 spheres:

KissingNumber(4) = 24
