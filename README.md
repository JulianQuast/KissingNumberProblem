KissingNumberProblem
====================

A computational analysis of the Kissing number problem

The class KissingNumberProblem.java contains the function kissTest.
The first argument is the Dimension of the testing, the second argument is the number of spheres.
For those who don't know the Kissing number problem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_number_problem

It's not possible to prove values with this algorithm, but we can find lower limits and guesses.
